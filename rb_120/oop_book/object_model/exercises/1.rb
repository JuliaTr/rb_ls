Exercise:
How do we create an object in Ruby? Give an example of 
the creation of an object.
=end

class Car
end

kia = Car.new

=begin
On line 4, an instamce of a class `Car` is created and stored
in a variable `kia`. The `kia` object is returned by calling
the class method `new`. Now `kia` is an object of class `Dog`
On lines 1-2, a class `Car` is cdefined. 
=end

=begin
In other words:
We've instantiated an object `kia` from the class `Car`.

Or:
An object is created by defining a class and instantiating 
it by using the `.new` method to create an instance object

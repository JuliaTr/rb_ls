Exercise:
Write a program called `age.rb` that asks a user how old they 
are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 
and 40 years. Below is the output for someone 20 years old.
=end

# Solution:
# age.rb
puts 'How old are you?'
age = gets.chomp.to_i

puts 'In 10 years you will be:'
puts age + 10

puts 'In 20 years you will be:'
puts age + 20

puts 'In 30 years you will be:'
puts age + 30

puts 'In 40 years you will be:'
puts age + 40

=begin
$ ruby 2.rb
How old are you?

In 10 years you will be:
30
In 20 years you will be:

In 30 years you will be:

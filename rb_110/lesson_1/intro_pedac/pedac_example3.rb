PEDAC

- Explicit requirements:
  - Input: string
  - Output: new string
  - Remove every other word from input string

- Questions:
1. What do we mean by 'every other word?'
  - How do we define what 'word' means in this context? 
    - If a string contain a number is it a 'word?'
    - If a string contain a non-alfanumeric symbol (like `)`, `%`) is it a 
      'word?' 
    - If a string contain a hyphenated word (like 'editor-in-chief') is it one
      or tree words? 
  - Do we want to delete odd or even words?

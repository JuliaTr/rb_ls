Practice Problem 6
Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, 
age and gender of each family member:
=end

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

munsters.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} is a #{value["age"]}-year-old #{value["gender"]}."
end

# Output:
# Herman is a 32-year-old male.
# Lily is a 30-year-old female.
# Grandpa is a 402-year-old male.
# Eddie is a 10-year-old male.
# Marilyn is a 23-year-old female.



## Solution from the assignment:
munsters.each_pair do |name, details|
  puts "#{name} is a #{details['age']}-year-old #{details['gender']}."
end

# Output:
# Herman is a 32-year-old male.
# Lily is a 30-year-old female.
# Grandpa is a 402-year-old male.
# Eddie is a 10-year-old male.

rules: "Hi, %s! Let me introduce rules of the game.\n
  You start with a 52-card deck which has 4 suits\n
  (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades), and 13 values\n
  (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack (10), queen (10), king (10), ace).\n
  The ace can be worth 1 or 11.\n
  \n
  There are 2 players 'dealer' and a 'player' (you). Each of you\n
  are initially dealt 2 cards. You can see your 2 cards, but\n
  can only see one of the dealer's cards.\n
  \n
  You go first, and can either 'hit' (ask for another card)\n
  or 'stay'. The turn is over when you either bust (go over 21) or stay.\n
  \n
  The goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible,\n
  without going over. If you bust, you lose.\n
  \n
  When you stay, it's the dealer's turn. The dealer must hit until the\n
  total is at least 17. If the dealer busts, then you win.\n
  \n
  When you both stay, the cards are compared to see\n
  who has the highest value.\n
  \n
  The game will go until you or the dealer earn 5 scores.\n
  Good luck!\n

# 1.  What will the following code output? Explain why.
a = "hello"
b = a
a << " world"
puts b    # hello world

# Improved explanation:
# The output is `hello world`.

# It illustrates the following concepts: variables as pointers, object 
# mutation, affecting multiple variables pointing to the same object.

# On line 1, a local variable `a` is initialized and references a String 
# object with the value `"hello"`. On line 2, a local variable `b` is 
# initialized and references the same object as `a`, pointing to the 
# same object, and having the same `object_id`. On line 3, the mutating 
# `String#<<` method, which mutates the caller, not creating and not 
# returning new objects, is invoked on the same object referenced by `a`, 
# appending `" world"` to it and mutating it. This is because, in Ruby, 
# strings, arrays, and hashes are mutable, contrasting with integers, 
# which are immutable. 

# On line 4, the object referenced by `b` is passed as an argument to 
# the `Kernel#puts` method invocation, outputting `hello world` to the 
# console.

# The `#puts` method returns `nil`, but the return value isn't used and 
# doesn't affect the output and the behavior of the code.



# Innitial explanation:
# The code snippet outputs `hello world`.

# It illustrates the variables ss pointers concept.

# On line 1, a local variable is initialized and references a String object 
# with a value `"hello"`. On line 2, a local variable `b` is initialized 
# and references the same object as `a`. Now, `a` and `b` point to the 
# same object. On line 3, the mutating `String#<<` method is invoked on 
# the object referenced by `a`, appending `" world"` to it and mutating it.

# Since `a` and `b` point to the same object, the `Kernel#puts` method 
# invocation, and the object referenced by `b` is passed to it as an 
# argument that will output `hello world` to the console. 

# The `#puts` method returns `nil`, but the return value isn't used in this 
# code snippet.
